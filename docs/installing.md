# Installing Anaconda/Python/Jupyter

### Install the software

To install anaconda with the associated tools, start with the 
[installation instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install) in the anaconda
documentation.  Follow the steps outlined for your operating system.  Unless you know what
you are doing, just accept all the defaults.

- [Windows](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/)
- [Mac OS](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/) -- follow the "graphical install" prompts.
- [Linux](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/) -- this requires executing an installation
shell script that you download from the anaconda site.

As well as installing the software, this process will set up anaconda navigator, 
which is a graphical tool for managing the software.
