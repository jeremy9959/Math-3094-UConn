# Lab Resources

This page includes links to a variety of resources to help with using the Anaconda/Python/Jupyter
environment that we rely on for labs.

Note: When you download a jupyter notebook (a `.ipynb` file), it is likely your system will
treat it as a text file and it may even append a `.txt` or `text` extension.  To open it in Jupyter
Lab, you will need to rename it to have just the `.ipynb` extension.  I recommend  keeping these
example notebooks in your "Math 3094" directory.

- [An overview of the python language (pdf)](published_notes/notes/Python-Basics.pdf) and the associated
[Jupyter notebook](notebooks/Python-Basics.ipynb)
- [Jupyter Notebook Walkthrough (Markdown Cells)](https://youtu.be/21LkohfneyA) and the example notebook created there. [ipynb](notebooks/TestNotebook.ipynb).
- A video walkthrough of linear algebra and plotting computations in the Jupyter Notebook. [The associated
