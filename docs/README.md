### Introduction

The interdisciplinary field known as Machine Learning or Data Science draws
together techniques from computer science, mathematics, and statistics to 
extract meaning from data.  In this course, we will discuss some of the
essential mathematical ideas in this field.  
While our focus will be on the role of Calculus, Probability, and Linear Algebra,
we will introduce computational techniques using Python and the Jupyter notebook
environment, and some ideas from statistics, in order to closely link theory
and practice.

### Resources

We will rely on the Python programming language, the Anaconda open source
data science platform, and the Jupyter notebook environment for our computer
work.  All of this software can be obtained for Linux, Mac, or Windows
from the Anaconda website: [www.anaconda.com](http://www.anaconda.com).
