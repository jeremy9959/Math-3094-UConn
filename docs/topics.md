### Gradient Descent

Goals:

- Learn the basic theory of gradient descent and how it is applied to find maxima and minima of functions
- Apply Gradient Descent to some specific examples.

### Probability

Goals:

- Get an introduction to the key ideas from probability that play a role in machine learning.
- Learn about mean, variance, independence, conditional probability, and Bayes theorem.
- Introduce the idea of maximum likelihood.

### Logistic Regression

Goals: 

- Understand the statistical model underlying logistic regression
- See how the ideas of likelihood and gradient descent combine to solve the logistic regression problem
- Do some sample computations to see Logistic Regression in action.
