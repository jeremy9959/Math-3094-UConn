# Course outline

## Part One

### Getting Set Up

Goals: 

- get a working installation of anaconda, python, and jupyter on your computer.
- a basic introduction to working with  the Jupyter notebook
  - code cells
  - markdown cells
- fundamentals of Python

### Linear Regression

Goals: 

- Learn the mathematics of Linear Regression (ordinary least squares) using Linear Algebra
- Lab: calculations and plotting examples of linear regression

### Principal Components and the Singular Value Decomposition

Goals:

- Understand the theory of principal components using linear algebra
- Learn how principal components analysis (PCA) can reveal structure in data
- Apply software tools that compute PCA to see the theory in action.

### Gradient Descent

Goals:

- Learn the basic theory of gradient descent and how it is applied to find maxima and minima of functions
- Apply Gradient Descent to some specific examples.

### Probability

Goals:

- Get an introduction to the key ideas from probability that play a role in machine learning.
- Learn about mean, variance, independence, conditional probability, and Bayes theorem.
- Introduce the idea of maximum likelihood.

### Logistic Regression

Goals: 

- Understand the statistical model underlying logistic regression
- See how the ideas of likelihood and gradient descent combine to solve the logistic regression problem
- Do some sample computations to see Logistic Regression in action.
