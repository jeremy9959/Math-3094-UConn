# Course outline

## Part One

### Linear Regression (1/18/21-1/29/21)

Goals 

- Learn the mathematics of Linear Regression (ordinary least squares) using Linear Algebra

- Lab: 
	- get a working installation of anaconda, python, and jupyter on your computer.
	- a basic introduction to working with  the Jupyter notebook
	- fundamentals of Python
	- calculations and plotting examples of linear regression

*References*

- Linear Regression [html](published_notes/LR.html)  [pdf](published_notes/LR.pdf)
- [Installing Anaconda](installing.md)
- [Jupyter Notebook Walkthrough (Markdown Cells)](https://youtu.be/21LkohfneyA)
- Linear Regression lab [ipynb](published_notes/RegressionLab.ipynb).  To use the lab, download
the `.ipynb` file into a directory you can access from Jupyter Lab (such as the Math 3094 directory
suggested in the videos).  Then open the file in Jupyter Lab.  *Note:* The file will likely be downloaded
as a text file.  You will need to rename the file so that it has the `.ipynb` extension.

### Gradient Descent

Goals:

- Learn the basic theory of gradient descent and how it is applied to find maxima and minima of functions
- Apply Gradient Descent to some specific examples.

### Probability

Goals:

- Get an introduction to the key ideas from probability that play a role in machine learning.
- Learn about mean, variance, independence, conditional probability, and Bayes theorem.
- Introduce the idea of maximum likelihood.

### Logistic Regression

Goals: 

- Understand the statistical model underlying logistic regression
- See how the ideas of likelihood and gradient descent combine to solve the logistic regression problem
- Do some sample computations to see Logistic Regression in action.
