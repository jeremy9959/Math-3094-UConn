# Second Project Assignment

## Overview

For your second project, use the "penguin" dataset and do an analysis on it.
You are free to do whatever you want using the ideas we have covered in this course -- or
any other machine learning technique you would like to experiment with. Report your results
as a jupyter notebook that explains what you did and includes any code you used to do it.

Alternatively, you may continue working with the dataset you used for your first project, and use
new techniques or refine your analysis.

We will use the last day of class (April 27th) and our assigned finals time (8-10 am on May 2 in Mont 321)
for presentations of the projects.

The original penguin dataset (packaged for the statistical language R) is available
[here.](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html)

A version of the dataset compiled into a csv file is available from kaggle
[here.](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data)

Feel free to get in touch with any questions.
