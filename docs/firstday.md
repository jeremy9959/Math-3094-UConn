- What is machine learning, at least from the perspective of this course (a math course)?
  
- We outline the topics we want to cover during the first part of the course.

	- Linear Regression
	- Gradient Descent
	- Basic Probability
	- Logistic Regression
	- Principal Components

We will see how these go before moving on to other topics such as Naive Bayes classifiers,
support vector machines, and neural networks.
