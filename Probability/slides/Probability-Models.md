# Models and Likelihood

## Statistical Models

- What is a statistical model? 

- What are parameters?

- What is likelihood?

- What is maximum likelihood?

\newpage
## Maximum Likelihood Example One - Coin Flipping

- Experiment is flipping a coin.

- Data is number of heads and tails out of $N$ flips

- Parameter $p$ is probability of heads.  What is most likely value of $p$ given the data?

\newpage
## Maximum Likelihood Example Two - Temperature Measurement

- Experiment is measuring the temperature

- Model says errors have mean zero around true temperature and normal distribution.

- Parameters are the true temperature and the variance of the error.

\newpage
## Maximum Likelihood Example Three - Linear Regression

- Experiment yields data $(x,y)$.

- Model says there are $m$ and $b$ with $y=mx+b+e$ where $e$ is normally distributed.

- Paramters are $m$, $b$, and the variance $\sigma^2$.
