\subsection{Introduction}\label{sec:Intro}}

Suppose that we are trying to study two quantities \(x\) and \(y\) that
we suspect are related -- at least approximately -- by a linear equation
\(y=ax+b\). Sometimes this linear relationship is predicted by
theoretical considerations, and sometimes it is just an empirical
hypothesis.

For example, if we are trying to determine the velocity of an object
travelling towards us at constant speed, and we measure measure the
distances \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) between us and the object at a
series of times \(t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n\), then since ``distance equals
rate times time'' we have a theoretical foundation for the assumption
that \(d=rt+b\) for some constants \(r\) and \(b\). On the other hand,
because of unavoidable experimental errors, we can't expect that this
relationship will hold exactly for the observed data; instead, we likely
get a graph like that shown in \cref{fig:dvt}. We've drawn a line on the
plot that seems to capture the true slope (and hence velocity) of the
object.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:dvt}{%
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,height=\textheight]{../img/distance-vs-time.png}
\caption{Physics Experiment}\label{fig:dvt}
}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, we might look at a graph such as
\cref{fig:mpg-vs-displacement}, which plots the gas mileage of various
car models against their engine size (displacement), and observe a
general trend in which bigger engines get lower mileage. In this
situation we could ask for the best line of the form \(y=mx+b\) that
captures this relationship and use that to make general conclusions
without necessarily having an underlying theory.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{sec:Calculus}{%
\subsection{Least Squares (via Calculus)}\label{sec:Calculus}}

In either of the two cases above, the question we face is to determine
the line \(y=mx+b\) that ``best fits'' the data
\(\{(x_i,y_i)_{i=1}^{N}\}\). The classic approach is to determine the
equation of a line \(y=mx+b\) that minimizes the ``mean squared error'':

\[ MSE(m,b) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i-mx_i-b)^2 \]

It's worth emphasizing that the \(MSE\) is a function of two variables
-- the slope \(m\) and the intercept \(b\) -- and that the data points
\(\{(x_i,y_i)\}\) are constants for these purposes. Furthermore, it's a
quadratic function in those two variables. Since our goal is to find
\(m\) and \(b\) that minimize the \(MSE\), we have a Calculus problem
that we can solve by taking partial derivatives and setting them to
zero.

To simplify the notation, let's abbreviate \(MSE\) by \(E\).

\[\begin{aligned} \frac{\partial E}{\partial m} &=
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{1}^{N}-2x_i(y_i-mx_i-b) \\ \frac{\partial E}{\partial
b} &= \frac{1}{N}\sum_{1}^{N}-2(y_i-mx_i-b) \\ \end{aligned} \]

We set these two partial derivatives to zero, so we can drop the \(-2\)
and regroup the sums to obtain two equations in two unknowns (we keep
the \(\frac{1}{N}\) because it is illuminating in the final result):

\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \frac{1}{N}(\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i^2)m &+&
\frac{1}{N}(\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i)b &=& \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i y_i
\\ \frac{1}{N}(\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i)m &+& b &=&
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{i} \\ \end{aligned} \label{eq:LS}\end{equation}

In these equations, notice that \(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i\) is the
average (or mean) value of the \(x_i\). Let's call this
\(\overline{x}\). Similarly, \(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{i}\) is the
mean of the \(y_i\), and we'll call it \(\overline{y}\). If we further
simplify the notation and write \(S_{xx}\) for
\(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i^2\) and \(S_{xy}\) for
\(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_iy_i\) then we can write down a solution to
this system using Cramer's rule:

\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} m &=
\frac{S_{xy}-\overline{x}\overline{y}}{S_{xx}-\overline{x}^2} \\ b &=
\frac{S_{xx}\overline{y}-S_{xy}\overline{x}}{S_{xx}-\overline{x}^2} \\
\end{aligned} \label{eq:LSAnswer}\end{equation}

where we must have \(S_{xx}-\overline{x}^2\not=0\).

  the \(x_i\)? Does it make sense that the problem of finding the ``line
  of best fit'' fails in this case?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{sec:LinAlg}{%
\subsection{Least Squares (via Geometry)}\label{sec:LinAlg}}

In our discussion above, we thought about our data as consisting of
\(N\) pairs \((x_i,y_i)\) corresponding to \(n\) points in the
\(xy\)-plane \(\mathbf{R}^2\). Now let's turn that picture ``on its
side'', and instead think of our data as consisting of \emph{two} points
in \(\mathbf{R}^{n}\):

\[ X=\left[\begin{matrix} x_1\cr x_2\cr \vdots\cr
x_n\end{matrix}\right] \mathrm{\ and\ } Y = \left[\begin{matrix}
y_1\cr y_2\cr \vdots\cr y_n\end{matrix}\right] \]

Let's also introduce one other vector

\[ E = \left[\begin{matrix} 1 \cr 1 \cr \vdots \cr
1\end{matrix}\right].  \]

First, let's assume that \(E\) and \(X\) are linearly independent. If
not, then \(X\) is a constant vector (why?) which we already know is a
problem from \cref{sec:Calculus}, Exercise 2. Therefore \(E\) and \(X\)
span a plane in \(\mathbf{R}^{n}\).

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:perp}{%
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,height=\textheight]{../img/distance-to-plane.png}
\caption{Distance to A Plane}\label{fig:perp}
}
\end{figure}

Now if our data points \((x_i,y_i)\) all \emph{did} lie on a line
\(y=mx+b\), then the three vectors \(X\), \(Y\), and \(E\) would be
linearly dependent:

\[ Y = mX + bE.  \]

Since our data is only approximately linear, that's not the case. So
instead we look for an approximate solution. One way to phrase that is
to ask:

\emph{What is the point \(\hat{Y}\) in the plane \(H\) spanned by \(X\)
and \(E\) in \(\mathbf{R}^{n}\) which is closest to \(Y\)?}

If we knew this point \(\hat{Y}\), then since it lies in \(H\) we would
have \(\hat{Y}=mX+bE\) and the coefficients \(m\) and \(b\) would be a
candidate for defining a line of best fit \(y=mx+b\). Finding the point
in a plane closest to another point in \(\mathbf{R}^{n}\) is a geometry
problem that we can solve.

\textbf{Proposition:} The point \(\hat{Y}\) in the plane spanned by
\(X\) and \(E\) is the point such that the vector \(Y-\hat{Y}\) is
perpendicular to \(H\).

\textbf{Proof:} See \cref{fig:perp} for an illustration -- perhaps you
are already convinced by this, but let's be careful. \(\hat{Y}=mX+bE\)
such that \[ D = \|Y-\hat{Y}\|^2 = \|Y-mX-bE\|^2 \] is minimal. Using
some vector calculus, we have \[ \frac{\partial D}{\partial m} =
\frac{\partial}{\partial m} (Y-mX-bE)\cdot (Y-mX-bE) =
-2(Y-mX-bE)\cdot X \] and \[ \frac{\partial D}{\partial b} =
\frac{\partial}{\partial b} (Y-mX-bE)\cdot (Y-mX-bE) =
-2(Y-mX-bE)\cdot E.  \]

So both derivatives are zero exactly when \(\hat{Y}=(Y-mX-bE)\) is
orthogonal to both \(X\) and \(E\), and therefore every vector in \(H\).

We also obtain equations for \(m\) and \(b\) just as in our first look
at this problem.

\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} m(X\cdot E) &+ b(E\cdot E) &= (Y\cdot E) \cr
m(X\cdot X) &+ b(E\cdot X) &= (Y\cdot X) \cr \end{aligned}
\label{eq:LSAnswer2}\end{equation}

We leave it is an exercise below to check that these are the same
equations that we obtained in \cref{eq:LSAnswer}.

\hypertarget{sec:Multivariate-calculus}{%
\subsection{The Multivariate Case
(Calculus)}\label{sec:Multivariate-calculus}}

Having worked through the problem of finding a ``line of best fit'' from
two points of view, let's look at a more general problem. We looked
above at a scatterplot showing the relationship between gas mileage and
engine size (displacement). There are other factors that might
contribute to gas mileage that we want to consider as well -- for
example: - a car that is heavy compared to its engine size may get worse
mileage - a sports car with a drive train that gives fast acceleration
as compared to a car with a transmission designed for long trips may
have different mileage for the same engine size.

Suppose we wish to use engine displacement, vehicle weight, and
acceleration all together to predict mileage. Instead of looking points
\((x_i,y_i)\) where \(x_i\) is the displacement of the \(i^{th}\) car
model and we try to predict a value \(y\) from a corresponding \(x\) as
\(y=mx+b\) -- let's look at a situation in which our measured value
\(y\) depends on multiple variables -- say displacement \(d\), weight
\(w\), and acceleration \(a\) with \(k=3\) -- and we are trying to find
the best linear equation

\begin{equation} y=m_1 d + m_2 w + m_3 a +b \label{eq:multivariate}\end{equation}

But to handle this situation more generally we need to adopt a
convention that will allow us to use indexed variables instead of \(d\),
\(w\), and \(a\). We will use the \emph{tidy} data convention.

\textbf{Tidy Data:} A dataset is tidy if it consists of values
\(x_{ij}\) for \(i=1,\ldots,N\) and \(j=1,\ldots, k\) so that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the row index corresponds to a \emph{sample} -- a set of measurements
  from a single event or item;
\item
  the column index corresponds to a \emph{feature} -- a particular
  property measured for all of the events or items.
\end{itemize}

In our case,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the \emph{samples} are the different types of car models,
\item
  the \emph{features} are the properties of those car models.
\end{itemize}

For us, \(N\) is the number of different types of cars, and \(k\) is the
number of properties we are considering. Since we are looking at
displacement, weight, and acceleration, we have \(k=3\).

So the ``independent variables'' for a set of data that consists of
\(N\) samples, and \(k\) measurements for each sample, can be
represented by a \(N\times k\) matrix

\[ X = \left(\begin{matrix} x_{11} & x_{12} & \cdots & x_{1k} \\
x_{21} & x_{22} & \cdots & x_{2k} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots
\\ x_{N1} & x_{k2} & \cdots & x_{Nk} \\ \end{matrix}\right) \]

and the measured dependent variables \(Y\) are a column vector \[ Y =
\left[\begin{matrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_N\end{matrix}\right].
\]

If \(m_1,\ldots, m_k\) are ``slopes'' associated with these properties
in \cref{eq:multivariate}, and \(b\) is the ``intercept'', then the
predicted value \(\hat{Y}\) is given by a matrix equation

\[ \hat{Y} = X\left[\begin{matrix} m_1 \\ m_2 \\ \cdots \\
m_k\end{matrix}\right]+\left[\begin{matrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ \cdots \\
1\end{matrix}\right]b \]

and our goal is to choose these parameters \(m_i\) and \(b\) to make the
mean squared error:

\[ MSE(m_1,\ldots, m_k,b) = \|Y-\hat{Y}\|^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i -
\sum_{j=1}^{k} x_{ij}m_j -b )^2.  \]

Here we are summing over the \(N\) different car models, and for each
model taking the squared difference between the true mileage \(y_i\) and
the ``predicted'' mileage \(\sum_{j=1}^{k} x_{ij}m_j +b\). We wish to
minimize this MSE.

Let's make one more simplification. The intercept variable \(b\) is
annoying because it requires separate treatment from the \(m_i\). But we
can use a trick to eliminate the need for special treatment. Let's add a
new feature to our data matrix (a new column) that has the constant
value \(1\).

\[ X = \left(\begin{matrix} x_{11} & x_{12} & \cdots & x_{1k} & 1\\
x_{21} & x_{22} & \cdots & x_{2k} & 1\\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots &
\vdots & 1\\ x_{N1} & x_{k2} & \cdots & x_{Nk} & 1\\
\end{matrix}\right) \]

Now our data matrix \(X\) is \(N\times(k+1)\) and we can put our
``intercept'' \(b=m_{k+1}\) into our vector of ``slopes''
\(m_1, \ldots, m_k,m_{k+1}\):

\[ \hat{Y} = X\left[\begin{matrix} m_1 \\ m_2 \\ \cdots \\ m_k \\
m_{k+1}\end{matrix}\right].  \]

and our MSE becomes

\[ MSE(M) = \|Y - XM\|^2 \]

where

\[ M=\left[\begin{matrix} m_1 \\ m_2 \\ \cdots \\ m_k \\
m_{k+1}\end{matrix}\right].  \]

\textbf{Remark:} Later on (see \cref{sec:centered}) we will see that if
we ``center'' our features about their mean, by subtracting the average
value of each column of \(X\) from that column; and we also subtract the
average value of \(Y\) from the entries of \(Y\), then the \(b\) that
emerges from the least squares fit is zero. As a result, instead of
adding a column of \(1\)'s, you can change coordinates to center each
feature about its mean, and keep your \(X\) matrix \(N\times k\).

The Calculus approach to minimizing the \(MSE\) is to take its partial
derivatives with respect to the \(m_{i}\) and set them to zero. Let's
first work out the derivatives in a nice form for later.

\textbf{Proposition:} The gradient of \(MSE(M)=E\) is given by

\begin{equation} \nabla E = \left[\begin{matrix} \frac{\partial}{\partial m_1}E \\ \frac{\partial}{\partial m_2}E \\ \vdots \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial m_{k+1}}E\end{matrix}\right] = -2 X^{\intercal}Y + 2
X^{\intercal}XM \label{eq:gradient}\end{equation}

where \(X^{\intercal}\) is the transpose of \(X\).

\textbf{Proof:} First, remember that the \(ij\) entry of
\(X^{\intercal}\) is the \(ji\) entry of \(X\). Also, we will use the
notation \(X[j,:]\) to mean the \(j^{th}\) row of \(X\) and \(X[:,i]\)
to mean the \(i^{th}\) column of \(X\). (This is copied from the Python
programming language; the `:' means that index runs over all
possibilities).

Since \[ E = \sum_{j=1}^{N} (Y_j-\sum_{s=1}^{k+1} X_{js}M_{s})^2 \] we
compute:
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned} \frac{\partial}{\partial m_t}E &= -2\sum_{j=1}^{N}
X_{jt}(Y_{j}-\sum_{s=1}^{k+1} X_{js}M_{s}) \\ &= -2(\sum_{j=1}^{N}
Y_{j}X_{jt} - \sum_{j=1}^{N}\sum_{s=1}^{k+1} X_{jt}X_{js}M_{s}) \\ &=
-2(\sum_{j=1}^{N} X^{\intercal}_{tj}Y_{j}
-\sum_{j=1}^{N}\sum_{s=1}^{k+1} X^{\intercal}_{tj}X_{js}M_{s}) \\ &=
-2(X^{\intercal}[t,:]Y - \sum_{s=1}^{k+1}\sum_{j=1}^{N}
X^{\intercal}_{tj}X_{js}M_{s}) \\ &= -2(X^{\intercal}[t,:]Y -
\sum_{s=1}^{k+1} (X^{\intercal}X)_{ts}M_{s}) \\ &=
-2(X^{\intercal}[t,:]Y - (X^{\intercal}X)[t,:]M)\\
\end{aligned}\label{eq:gradient2}\end{equation}

Stacking up the different rows to make \(E\) yields the desired formula.

\textbf{Proposition:} Assume that \(D=X^{\intercal}X\) is invertible
(notice that it is a \((k+1)\times(k+1)\) square matrix so this makes
sense). The solution \(M\) to the multivariate least squares problem is
\begin{equation} M =
D^{-1}X^{\intercal}Y \label{eq:Msolution}\end{equation} and the
``predicted value'' \(\hat{Y}\) for \(Y\) is
\begin{equation} \hat{Y} = XD^{-1}X^{\intercal}Y.
\label{eq:projection}\end{equation}

\hypertarget{the-multivariate-case-geometry}{%
\subsection{The Multivariate Case
(Geometry)}\label{the-multivariate-case-geometry}}

Let's look more closely at the equation obtained by setting the gradient
of the error, \cref{eq:gradient}, to zero. Remember that \(M\) is the
unknown vector in this equation, everything else is known:

\[ X^{\intercal}Y = X^{\intercal}XM \]

Here is how to think about this:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  As \(M\) varies, the \(N\times 1\) matrix \(XM\) varies over the space
  spanned by the columns of the matrix \(X\). So as \(M\) varies \(XM\)
  is a general element of the subspace \(H\) of \(R^{N}\) spanned by the
  \(k+1\) columns of \(X\).
\item
  The product \(X^{\intercal}XM\) is a \((k+1)\times 1\) matrix. Each
  entry is the dot product of the general element of \(H\) with one of
  the \(k+1\) basis vectors of \(H\).
\item
  The product \(X^{\intercal}Y\) is a \((k+1)\times 1\) matrix whose
  entries are the dot product of the basis vectors of \(H\) with \(Y\).
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, this equation asks for us to find \(M\) so that the vector
\(XM\) in \(H\) has the same dot products with the basis vectors of
\(H\) as \(Y\) does. The condition

\[ X^{\intercal}\cdot (Y-XM)=0 \]

says that \(Y-XM\) is orthogonal to \(H\). This argument establishes the
following proposition.

\textbf{Proposition:} Just as in the simple one-dimensional case, the
predicted value \(\hat{Y}\) of the least squares problem is the point in
\(H\) closest to \(Y\) -- or in other words the point \(\hat{Y}\) in
\(H\) such that \(Y-\hat{Y}\) is perpendicular to \(H\).

\hypertarget{orthogonal-projection}{%
\subsubsection{Orthogonal Projection}\label{orthogonal-projection}}

Recall that we introduced the notation \(D=X^{\intercal}X\), and let's
assume, for now, that \(D\) is an invertible matrix. We have the formula
(see \cref{eq:projection}): \[ \hat{Y} = XD^{-1}X^{\intercal}Y.  \]
\textbf{Proposition:} The matrix \(P=XD^{-1}X^{\intercal}\) is an
\(N\times N\) matrix called the orthogonal projection operator onto the
subspace \(H\) spanned by the columns of \(X\). It has the following
properties:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(PY\) belongs to the subspace \(H\) for any \(Y\in\mathbf{R}^{N}\).
\item
  \((Y-PY)\) is orthogonal to \(H\).
\item
  \(P*P = P\).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Proof:} First of all, \(PY=XD^{-1}X^{\intercal}Y\) so \(PY\) is
a linear combination of the columns of \(X\) and is therefore an element
of \(H\). Next, we can compute the dot product of \(PY\) against a basis
of \(H\) by computing

\[ X^{\intercal}PY = X^{\intercal}XD^{-1}X^{\intercal}Y =
X^{\intercal}Y \]

since \(X^{\intercal}X=D\). This equation means that
\(X^{\intercal}(Y-PY)=0\) which tells us that \(Y-PY\) has dot product
zero with a basis for \(H\). Finally,

\[ PP = XD^{-1}X^{\intercal}XD^{-1}X^{\intercal} =
XD^{-1}X^{\intercal}=P.  \]

It should be clear from the above discussion that the matrix
\(D=X^{\intercal}X\) plays an important role in the study of this
problem. In particular it must be invertible or our analysis above
breaks down. In the next section we will look more closely at this
matrix and what information it encodes about our data.

\hypertarget{sec:centered}{%
\subsection{Centered coordinates}\label{sec:centered}}

Recall from last section that the matrix \(D=X^{\intercal}X\) is of
central importance to the study of the multivariate least squares
problem. Let's look at it more closely.

\textbf{Lemma:} The \(i,j\) entry of \(D\) is the dot product \[
D_{ij}=X[:,i]\cdot X[:,j] \] of the \(i^{th}\) and \(j^{th}\) columns of
\(X\).

\textbf{Proof:} In the matrix multiplication \(X^{\intercal}X\), the
\(i^{th}\) row of \(X^{\intercal}\) gets ``dotted'' with the \(j^{th}\)
column of \(X\) to product the \(i,j\) entry. But the \(i^{th}\) row of
\(X^{\intercal}\) is the \(i^{th}\) column of \(X\), as asserted in the
statement of the lemma.

A crucial point in our construction above relied on the matrix \(D\)
being invertible. The following Lemma shows that \(D\) fails to be
invertible only when the different features (the columns of \(X\)) are
linearly dependent.

\textbf{Lemma:} \(D\) is not invertible if and only if the columns of
\(X\) are linearly dependent.

\textbf{Proof:} If the columns of \(X\) are linearly dependent, then
there is a nonzero vector \(m\) so that \(Xm=0\). In that case clearly
\(Dm=X^{\intercal}Xm=0\) so \(D\) is not invertible. Suppose \(D\) is
not invertible. Then there is a nonzero vector \(m\) with
\(Dm=X^{\intercal}Xm=0\). This means that the vector \(Xm\) is
orthogonal to all of the columns of \(X\). Since \(Xm\) belongs to the
span \(H\) of the columns of \(X\), if it is orthogonal to \(H\) it must
be zero.

In fact, the matrix \(D\) captures some important statistical measures
of our data, but to see this clearly we need to make a slight change of
basis. First recall that \(X[:,k+1]\) is our column of all \(1\), added
to handle the intercept. As a result, the dot product
\(X[:,i]\cdot X[:,k+1]\) is the sum of the entries in the \(i^{th}\)
column, and so if we let \(\mu_{i}\) denote the average value of the
entries in column \(i\), we have \[ \mu_{i} = \frac{1}{N}(X[:,i]\cdot
X[:,k+1]) \]

Now change the matrix \(X\) by elementary column operations to obtain a
new data matrix \(X_{0}\) by setting \[ X_{0}[:,i] =
X[:,i]-\frac{1}{N}(X[:,i]\cdot X[:,k+1])X[:,k+1] =
X[:,i]-\mu_{i}X[:,k+1] \] for \(i=1,\ldots, k\).

In terms of the original data, we are changing the measurement scale of
the data so that each feature has average value zero, and the subspace
\(H\) spanned by the columns of \(X_{0}\) is the same as that spanned by
the columns of \(X\). Using \(X_{0}\) instead of \(X\) for our least
squares problem, we get

\[ \hat{Y} = X_{0}D_{0}^{-1}X_{0}^{\intercal}Y \]

and

\[ M_{0} = D_{0}^{-1}X_{0}^{\intercal}Y \]

where \(D_{0}=X_{0}^{\intercal}X_{0}.\)

\textbf{Proposition:} The matrix \(D_{0}\) has a block form. Its upper
left block is a \(k\times k\) symmetric block with entries
\[ (D_{0})_{ij} =
(X[:,i]-\mu_{i}X[:,k+1])\cdot(X[:,j]-\mu_{j}X[:,k+1]) \] Its
\((k+1)^{st}\) row and column are all zero, except for the
\((k+1),(k+1)\) entry, which is \(N\).

\textbf{Proof:} This follows from the fact that the last row and column
entries are (for \(i\not=k+1\)): \[ (X[:,i]-\mu_{i}X[:,k+1])\cdot
X[:,k+1] = (X[:,i]\cdot X[:,k+1])-N\mu_{i} = 0 \] and for \(i=k+1\) we
have \(X[:,k+1]\cdot X[:,k+1]=N\) since that column is just \(N\)
\(1\)'s.

\textbf{Proposition:} If the \(x\) coordinates (the features) are
centered so that they have mean zero, then the intercept \(b\) is
\[ \overline{Y} =
\frac{1}{N}\sum y_{i}.  \]

\textbf{Proof:} By centering the coordinates, we replace the matrix
\(X\) by \(X_{0}\) and \(D\) by \(D_{0}\). and we are trying to minimize
\(\|Y-X_{0}M_{0}\|^2\). Use the formula from \cref{eq:Msolution} to see
that \[ M_{0} = D_{0}^{-1}X_{0}^{\intercal}Y.  \] The \(b\) value we are
interested in is the last entry \(m_{k+1}\) in \(M_{0}\). From the block
form of \(D_{0}\), we know that \(D_{0}^{-1}\) has bottom row and last
column zero except for \(1/N\) in position \((k+1)\times(k+1)\). Also
\(X_{0}^{\intercal}\) has last row consisting entirely of \(1\). So the
bottom entry of \(X_{0}^{\intercal}Y\) is \(\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{i}\), and
the bottom entry \(b\) of \(D_{0}^{-1}X_{0}^{\intercal}Y\) is
\[ \mu_{Y} =
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{i}.  \] as claimed.

\textbf{Corollary:} If we make a further change of coordinates to define
\[
Y_{0} = Y - \mu_{Y}\left[\begin{matrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\
1\end{matrix}\right] \] then the associated \(b\) is zero. As a result
we can forget about the extra column of \(1's\) that we added to \(X\)
to account for it and reduce the dimension of our entire problem by
\(1\).

Just to recap, if we center our data so that \(\mu_{Y}=0\) and
\(\mu_{i}=0\) for \(i=1,\ldots, k\), then the least squares problem
reduces to minimizing \[ E(M) = \|Y-XM\|^2 \] where \(X\) is the
\(N\times k\) matrix with \(j^{th}\) row
\((x_{j1},x_{j2},\ldots, x_{jk})\) for \(j=1,\ldots, N\) and the
solutions are as given in \cref{eq:Msolution} and \cref{eq:projection}.

Regression}\label{caveats-about-linear-regression}}

\hypertarget{basic-considerations}{%
\subsubsection{Basic considerations}\label{basic-considerations}}

Reflecting on our long discussion up to this point, we should take note
of some of the potential pitfalls that lurk in the use of linear
regression.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  When we apply linear regression, we are explicitly assuming that the
  variable \(Y\) is associated to \(X\) via linear equations. This is a
  big assumption!
\item
  When we use multilinear regression, we are assuming that changes in
  the different features have independent effects on the target variable
  \(y\). In other words, suppose that \(y=ax_1+bx_2\). Then an increase
  of \(x_1\) by \(1\) increases \(y\) by \(a\), and an increase of
  \(x_2\) by \(1\) increases \(y\) by \(b\). These effects are
  independent of one another and combine to yield an increase of
  \(a+b\).
\item
  We showed in our discussion above that linear regression problem has a
  solution when the matrix \(D=X^{\intercal}X\) is invertible, and this
  happens when the columns of \(D\) are linearly independent. When
  working with real data, which is messy, we could have a situation in
  which the features we are studying are, in fact, dependent -- but
  because of measurement error, the samples that we collected aren't. In
  this case, the matrix \(D\) will be ``close'' to being non-invertible,
  although formally still invertible. In this case, computing \(D^{-1}\)
  leads to numerical instability and the solution we obtain is very
  unreliable.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{simpsons-effect}{%
\subsubsection{Simpson's Effect}\label{simpsons-effect}}

Simpson's effect is a famous phenomenon that illustrates that linear
regression can be very misleading in some circumstances. It is often a
product of ``pooling'' results from multiple experiments. Suppose, for
example, that we are studying the relationship between a certain measure
of blood chemistry and an individual's weight gain or less on a
particular diet. We do our experiments in three labs, the blue, green,
and red labs. Each lab obtains similar results -- higher levels of the
blood marker correspond to greater weight gain, with a regression line
of slope around 1. However, because of differences in the population
that each lab is studying, some populations are more susceptible to
weight gain and so the red lab sees a mean increase of almost 9 lbs
while the blue lab sees a weight gain of only 3 lbs on average.

The three groups of scientists pool their results to get a larger sample
size and do a new regression. Surprise! Now the regression line has
slope \(-1.6\) and increasing amounts of the marker seem to lead to
\emph{less} weight gain!

This is called Simpson's effect, or Simpson's paradox, and it shows that
unknown factors (confounding factors) may cause linear regression to
yield misleading results. This is particularly true when data from
experiments conducted under different conditions is combined; in this
case, the differences in experimental setting, called \emph{batch
effects}, can throw off the analysis very dramatically. See
\cref{fig:simpsons} .

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  When proving that \(D\) is invertible if and only if the columns of
  \(X\) are linearly independent, we argued that if
  \(X^{\intercal}Xm=0\) for a nonzero vector \(m\), then \(Xm\) is
  orthogonal to the span of the columns of \(X\), and is also an element
  of that span, and is therefore zero. Provide the details: show that if
  \(H\) is a subspace of \(\mathbf{R}^{N}\), and \(x\) is a vector in
  \(H\) such that \(x\cdot h=0\) for all \(h\in H\), then \(x=0\).
