# Linear Regression 

## Introduction

Linear regression is a prototypical machine learning algorithm.   To get a feel
for it, let's look at some data on the relationship between engine size and gas mileage
for a group of cars (see [UCI-auto-mpg] or, for a nicely formatted csv version, 
[kaggle-auto-mpg]).

In its simplest
version, we start with the assumption that a particular quantity $y$ that we would like
to understand depends on a quantity $x$ that we know through a linear relationship:
Also, we have $x\in\R$.

Here is a picture:
